      <h2>Something About Me...</h2>
      <p id="bio">
        I fell in love with technology after the entrance of the iPhone in 2007.
        I had already had a general interest with tech prior to the iphoneâ€™s
        release but after witnessing what could be done with tech, I was hooked.
        That led me to work at companies like AT&amp;T and Mosaic to quench my
        thirst for all things tech. That passion eventually lead me on a journey
        to learn to build technology thru code. I recently finished a full stack
        flex program in Web Development and i'm now looking to build robust
        applications with a fast-paced and growing company.
